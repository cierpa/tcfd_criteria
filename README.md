# TCFD Recommended Disclosure Criteria

[日本語はこちら](README_ja.md)

## Abstract

TCFD recommended disclosure criteria serve as guidelines for assessing whether a company's disclosures align with each of the 11 items recommended for disclosure by the TCFD recommendations (hereafter, TCFD recommended disclosures). Each criterion was developed by extracting the key elements of each TCFD recommended disclosure based on [the Guidance on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 3.0 (TCFD Guidance 3.0)](https://tcfd-consortium.jp/en/news_detail/22100501).

This document enumerates and names each TCFD recommended disclosure as shown below and defines the associated criteria.
